CPSC 456 Project 1: Relicator Worm

Members: David Poss, Gerard Cortes, Billy Dang

Usage: $python replicator.py <username file> <password file>

Notes: 
1. The worm will leave a marker "gotcha.txt" file that says which IP infected that machine.
2. Run the script with all files (worm, username and password files) in the same directory.
3. The worm only checks the target directory (by default /home/<cracked username>) on the remote system for the worm, so if you launch the worm from a directory other than the target directory (like launching it from /tmp/ but specifying the target directory as /home/cpsc), the initial system be infected as well unless the worm is in its /home/<cracked username> directory.
